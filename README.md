# Port-Scanner

A simple port scanner written in python. The number of ports to be scanned can be changed on line 8 of port_scanner.py. ipscan.py is a simple example of importing the program. Based on code by Joe Parys and Aleksa Tamburkovski. See my vulnerability scanner for an evolution of this code into OOP.
